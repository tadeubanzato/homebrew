# Homebrew setup for new Macs
## ü§ñ The Automated Way
I create a shell script that essentially do the same steps as below wihout having to manually execute it one by one.
To execute it you can simply run the below command on your Terminal window.
```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tadeubanzato/homebrew/main/auto_install.sh)"
```
The raw version of the file is named: auto_install.sh

## ü§üüèº The Manual Way
In case you do not want to use the automated script you can follow the below instructions and install all packages autmanually
### Step 1 - Install Xcode
```bash
xcode-select --install
```
### Step 2 - Install Homebrew
The below command will install Homebrew, follow any aditional instructions after installation.
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

### Step3 - Instal ZSH and oh-my-zsh
I personally like to use oh-my-zsh to customize my prompt and cousor.
> You can see some personlization instructions here: https://github.com/tadeubanzato/PersonalMacPrompt
```bash
brew install zsh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```
